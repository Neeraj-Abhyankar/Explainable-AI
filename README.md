# Explainable-AI
Performed annotation of 1024 images based on 15 handcrafted features per image. Built Bayesian Inference Network to verify similar writers with Seen, Unseen and Shuffled from the given dataset with avg. accuracy 74%.  Compared similar results for Auto-Encoders based networks at 82% accuracy and avg. similarity score of 80.  For the Explainable AI, the output of a ‘Multi-Task Learning Network’ was mapped with annotated handcrafted features for similarity comparison which showed around 85% accuracy with more Explainability towards mapped features.
